      Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy
      metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The
      band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm
      guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and
      backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny
      Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for
      its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and
      merchandise. The band emerged with a metalcore sound on their debut
      album "Sounding the Seventh Trumpet" and continued this sound through
      their second album Waking the Fallen. However, the band's style had
      evolved by the group's third album and first major label release, City
      of Evil, into a heavy metal and hard rock style. The band continued to
      explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed continued
      mainstream success before their drummer, James "The Rev" Sullivan,
      died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with
      the help of drummer Mike Portnoy (Dream Theater), and released and
      toured in support of their fifth album Nightmare in 2010, which
      debuted on the top spot of the Billboard 200.

      To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums, one live
      album/DVD, two compilation albums and eighteen singles and have sold
      over 8 million albums worldwide. They have also released an original
      song for each game in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series, all of which
      were compiled together in the 2018 EP Black Reign. The band were
      ranked No. 47 on Loudwire's list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.
